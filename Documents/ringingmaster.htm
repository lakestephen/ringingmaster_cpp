<H3 align=center><A name=ringingmaster>Ringing Master for Windows 9x,2000,ME,NT4.0,XP</A></H3>
<DL> 
  <DT><B>What it runs on</B> 
  <DD> PCs with Windows 9x,2000,ME,NT4.0,XP and a sound card (if you want to hear the 
    bells). At least P100 processor recommended. CD-ROM drive or web access required 
    for installation. 
  <DT><B>What it does</B> 
  <DD> Ringing Master is a thoroughly modern &amp; professional, touch / peal 
    proving program. Ringing Master proves touches 'on the fly' (as you type). 
    This means that the touch is proved, analyzed and the results displayed live 
    (including lead heads), as you work on it. In reality it takes about <b>20 
    milliseconds</b> to prove and analyze a peal of 8 spliced. 
  <dd> It will accept most normal touch formats. You have as much or as little 
    control over every part of the process as you want. The flexibility built 
    in to the normal method definition allows you define any method in any way, 
    allowing the program to cope with oddball methods like Stedman, naturally 
    and easily, rather than building in specific support for each method. 
  <dd>The user interface allows much customization along the lines of Microsoft 
    Word. You can set up the whole interface to your own liking, produce your 
    own menus of the functions you use regularly, even have an XP or standard 
    look and feel. 
  <dd>Features include: Coloured touch entry grid system, highlighting how the 
    touch is being interpreted &amp; red underlining potential faults. Natural 
    bell sounds with control over speed &amp; quality. Method Explorer (like Windows 
    Explorer) and powerful method database search engine. Control over the exact 
    style of display of blue lines. Printing of touch, blue line and analysis 
    reports. Visual notation editor that allows you to draw your method graphically, 
    then search the database to find its name. Comprehensive analysis is displayed 
    live.
